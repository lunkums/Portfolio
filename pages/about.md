# Lunkums

Hi. I'm Luke Leedy, but on the internet, I go by a bastardization of my first name: Lunkums.

This is a personal portfolio theme that I built using the [DevTips Starter Kit](http://devtipsstarterkit.com/) as a foundation, following a tutorial by [Travis Neilson over at DevTips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6jKLsxbFg4&list=PL0CB3OvPhDA_STygmp3sDenx3UpdOMk7P). You can [check out the demo](lenpaul.github.io/portfolio-jekyll-theme/) and [fork the repository](https://github.com/LeNPaul/portfolio-jekyll-theme/fork) to support him.
