# Reading List

When I was in grade school, I loathed reading for two reasons: it was required; and it was boring. Towards the end of my college education, I began to understand the importance of reading in learning. After entering the workforce, I discovered that reading was also an effective remedy for the stress of constant stimulation in the Information Age. Now, I try to read as often as I can and I keep a list of the books I've read to completion (though I will skip the occasional chapter or two if it's a dense, technical book). The best books I read don't deserve to sit on a shelf, and so I give them away.

If there's a free, as in ethically free, copy of the book on the internet, I'll include a link to it, too.
