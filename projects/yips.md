## Description

_The year is 2003. Rapid advancements in technology, including the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), have taken the world by storm. As is the human way of doing things, our goal was to answer silly questions such as “what if” and “how,” but not important ones, like “why.” Now, Pandora's box is open and the threat of AI gaining consciousness and agency is imminent. After observing the strange behavior of artificial actors in the laboratory, the main research facility responsible for the creation of AGI was put on a strict lockdown. Still inside are dozens of researchers who were assigned to monitor the state of the AI and keep the outside world informed. Their comms have gone silent and you must investigate. How will you tell what’s real?_

_Yips_ (an anagram of "I Spy") is a 2D top-down deduction game where you must determine what is human from what is AI-generated. Using your detective skills, you must analyze each character on factors including appearance, voice, and dialogue to decide who has been infected by the AI virus. While quick, the virus isn't strong enough to completely consume someone: each character may only have one characteristic of AI. Decide who is completely real and who isn't to discover your ability to identify generative content.

#### Background

_Yips_ was developed by 4 students in about 2 weeks as the final project for an English class about analyzing video games. The goal of the project was to determine the efficacy of AI-generative tools in content creation for video games.

## Features

#### Explore the Lab

Trapped in the lab are more than a dozen researchers and volunteers all featuring detailed character portraits, personal dialogue responses, and full-voice acting. Explore the lab to learn the names, faces, words, and voices of its occupants.

#### Judge the Power of AI

Witness the power of AI-generative tools such as [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [ElevenLabs](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/), and [Bing](https://www.bing.com/). Judge the power of these tools by determining which characters were created using them, or fail to notice.

#### Perfect for a Party

Play by yourself or with a group of back-seating friends! _Yips_ is a game of deduction, and 2 minds are greater than 1. Work together to dissect dialogue, vocal inflections, and artistic inconsistencies.
